### POST-HOC TESTS##########
########################


# We just proved that the 3 groups are different, we still do not know
# which one is different. We could perform several t-tests
# but the probability of observing one significant result
# due to chance gets quickly high even with just 3 groups.

#Some other analysis must be performed, sometimes called post-hoc 
#analysis (maybe not in slides)

#Discuss quickly about Bonferroni correction in slides

#performing Turkey test to correct p-values 
Turkey_test <- TukeyHSD(res_aov)
#showing results, in particular p adj
